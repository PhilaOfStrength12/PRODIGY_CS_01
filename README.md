The Caesar Cipher is one of the most basic and oldest techniques of encrypting information, named after Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it to protect his military communications. This approach involves moving the letters of the alphabet by a predetermined number of positions. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher laid the foundation for modern encryption approaches. It is just a type of substitution cipher, which means that each letter of a given text is replaced with a letter from a specified number of positions down the alphabet.

Substitution cipher: The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter at a set location down the alphabet.

The Caesar cipher employs a fixed key, which specifies the number of positions by which the letters are altered. This key is known by both the sender and the receiver.
Symmetric encryption: The Caesar cipher uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

The Caesar cipher has a very small keyspace of only 26 potential keys, which corresponds to the number of letters in the English alphabet.
The Caesar cipher is vulnerable to brute force assaults because there are only 26 keys to test.
The Caesar cipher is simple to build and needs only basic arithmetic operations, making it a common choice for simple encryption jobs.
