The Caesar Cipher is one of the most basic and oldest techniques of encrypting information, named after Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it to protect his military communications. This approach involves moving the letters of the alphabet by a predetermined number of positions. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher laid the foundation for modern encryption approaches. It is just a type of substitution cipher, which means that each letter of a given text is replaced with a letter from a specified number of positions down the alphabet.
